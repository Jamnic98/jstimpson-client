# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal **Next.js** project where I showcase my coding projects and interactive content.

I built it using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and enhanced it with a range of features to make it dynamic and engaging.

## What I Built

- **Project Showcases**: I display my coding projects with descriptions, tech stack, screenshots, and links. Each project can even include its README rendered directly on the page.
- **Strava API Integration**: I fetch my activity data from Strava automatically. The backend handles refresh tokens, so the data stays up to date without any manual intervention.
- **3D Models with Three.js**: I embed interactive 3D models to make the site more visual and engaging. Users can rotate, zoom, and interact with the models.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Any README content or project documentation can be displayed in clean markdown format with headings, lists, code blocks, and images.
- **Responsive and Styled**: The site is fully responsive and styled with Tailwind CSS, including proper typography for headings, code, lists, and images.

## How It Works

- The backend handles API requests and refresh tokens for external services like Strava.
- Markdown content is fetched and rendered with proper styling and syntax highlighting.
- Three.js models are embedded and interactive directly in the frontend.
- Tailwind CSS ensures everything is responsive and visually consistent.

This project demonstrates my ability to build full-stack interactive web applications using modern frameworks and APIs.
