    `Around the start of August 2021, I became interested in cryptocurrency investing and wanted to monitor the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum
     without needing to regularly check online. My solution was to build a circuit with some electronic components and program a NodeMCU ESP-12 wifi
     enabled micro-controller using C++ to request cryptocurrency prices from Coinbase. To display the prices, I initially connected
     a 2.2 inch TFT display, which worked well,projects as multiple prices could be displayed at once.`,

    `Unfortunately, after about a month of use, one of the components on the board which controlled the display blew,
     so I replaced it with the only other screen I had at the time, which was a 16x2 LCD screen.
     To display more than two cryptocurrencies at a time, I coded the ESP-12 to cycle through the price strings,
     giving them the appearance of being shifted upwards incrementally.`,
