  summary: 'A custom, mobile-responsive website I built for a client.',
  paragraphs: [
    `This is a custom-built web project I created for a client, making use of Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and MongoDB. Prior to starting, the client and I had an in-depth discussion about the scope of the project, key features and overall design.
      With the information gathered, I decided to leverage Next.js for its static site generation features and powerful SEO tooling to ensure an optimal user experience and search engine visibility. 
      The implementation of Next.js' built-in Image optimization would also complement the visual aspect of this image-rich website.
      Using TailwindCSS I was able to make a mobile-responsive design that caters to various devices and screen sizes.
      With Next.js' API I set up a simple endpoint and integrated database functionality to store data from a mailing list form.
      Overall, "Alt World" demonstrates a modern, performant, and visually appealing web presence tailored to the client's needs and expectations.`,
